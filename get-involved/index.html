                    <p class = "intern-text">As a STEMchats Intern, you will be onboarded onto one team (either Programming or Business-Development) that you applied to be a part of, <b>contributing 5-10 hours of work per week</b>. Your role will consist of attending meeting calls, being assigned tasks to advance team goals, receiving mentorship from Program Leads, working alongside Program Coordinators, and receiving training from the Leadership Team. If selected as a STEMchats Intern, <b>we expect you to be dedicated and committed to your role</b>, showcasing your work ethic and advancing our team culture.</p>
                    <p class = "intern-text">It is critical for you to understand that our Internship program is designed to efficiently and comfortably integrate you into our team; <b>the end goal is for you to become a permanent team member</b>! Our Intern program is not meant to just be a summer commitment, it is instead a stepping stone to becoming a permanent team member. The 2020 STEMchats Internship is <b>set to begin July 20th and end August 31st</b>. If extended an invitation to become a permanent team member, and you are able to keep up your commitment, we expect you to accept.</p>
                    <h2 class = "intern-title">Eligibility & Logistics</h2>
                    <p class = "intern-text">As STEMchats is an entirely student-run STEM equity nonprofit, <b>only students who will still be in high school or college during the 2020-2021 academic school year are eligible to apply</b>. Furthermore, as our team is also made up mostly of underrepresented students in STEM, we are primarily looking for students from first-generation, low-income backgrounds and/or minorities including women, people of color (POC), LGBTQ+,  students with disabilities, and students attending rural and/or underfunded high schools; however, we <b>welcome different perspectives and all students regardless of background are encouraged to apply</b>! International students (those residing outside of the United States) should apply, being aware that all STEMchats team meeting times are scheduled to accommodate US time zones. Ultimately, we hope to evaluate applications in which passion and values aligning with our mission shine through.</p>
                    <p class = "intern-text">On the application, you have the choice of ranking up to three teams you would like to be a part of at STEMchats; feel free to rank all Programming or Business-Development teams, or both! We recommend you rank three teams, but keep in mind that <b>you must answer all of the additional team specific questions</b>; not answering all respective questions will negatively affect your application. Please also keep in mind that our application is a Google Form and a Gmail account is necessary to view it as well as upload any relevant or required additional materials. A Gmail account will be required upon joining our team!</p>

Certain programs, like United Engineers and STEMchats Institute, are an exception because interns will be expected to assist with development of STEM-related curriculum (and eventually hands-on workshop instruction), so they are expected to have some background and demonstrated interest in relevant STEM fields. But since we target first-generation/low-income students who might not have had extensive opportunities to pursue STEM, we are in no way expecting a deep STEM background and have structured the internship as an immersive educational experience. We hope the application allows each applicant to express how their experience and perspective can be of value for STEMchats; we do not have a perfect applicant in mind and many of our current team members did not have a comprehensive STEM background when applying.</div>

                    <h3>We are <b>Inclusive.</b></h3>
                    <p>STEMchats thrives on its diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and ideas! This means that we have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination, hate, or bullying. All of our team members are expected to be inclusive of others on the team and make everyone feel valued regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, location, sex, gender, or any other factors.</p>

                <div class = "col-lg-12 culture-box">
                    <h3>We are <b>Collaborative.</b></h3>
                    <p>STEMchats relies on teamwork and collaboration between all members of the organization to uphold our founding principles: celebrate, stimulate, innovate. We encourage appropriate collaboration, both within each team and across both programming and business-development departments.</p>
                    <p>All team members are expected to actively participate in assigned collaborations or work to come up with new ways to work with members outside their direct team. The  Leadership Team does their best to facilitate this kind of interaction through transparency, connection, Slack, and in-person meetups.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "col-lg-12 culture-box">
                    <h3>We are <b>Encouraging.</b></h3>
                    <p>STEMchats succeeds thanks to positive energy and reinforcement from everyone on our team! We often hype each other up on social media, on calls, and in our dedicated #random Slack channel. Every team member is encouraged to contribute to discussions with the assurance that their opinions will always be valued. We feel that this is the best way to build up both individual and collective confidence, helping us break out of our shells!</p>
                    <p>STEMchats works on uplifting underrepresented students while creating a close and supportive network in the process. Our STEMchats team members who are in college are always down to answer any questions about the admissions process. Since many of us are first-generation, low-income (FGLI) college students, we understand the confusion. We are all here to support and encourage one another across personal and professional spheres</p>

                <div class = "col-lg-12 culture-box">
                    <h3>We are <b>Laidback.</b></h3>
                    <p>STEMchats is chill. No, really! Just like most startups and modern GenZ organizations, we love sharing memes over Slack and keeping a light, laidback mood during video calls. We have non-work related channels that every team member can join: #college, #opportunities, #memes, & more.</p>
                    <p>This doesn’t mean we don’t get our work done. In fact, we’ve found that sometimes getting off-topic ultimately increases our productivity, making any long calls or action items more manageable through building team comradery! We are all friends and hope that everyone on the team can build strong bonds beyond work and geographic location.</p>
