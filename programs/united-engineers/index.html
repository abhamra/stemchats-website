                    <p class = "program-box-text">United Engineers is one of STEMchat’s Stimulate programs, providing opportunities for students year-round. In the summer, United Engineers hosts virtual design thinking challenges which students ages 16-18 can join to propose solutions to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, the program’s main goal is to engage middle school students from low-income, first generation, and minority backgrounds through 10-week workshops during the school year. We work with public middle schools in <b>New York, NY, Philadelphia, PA, and Boston, MA</b>. Depending on the locations and school calendars, these local workshops occur between August and May during fall and spring school semesters.</p>
                    <!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="https://stemchats1.createsend.com/t/t/p/ijilhl/0/0/0/1/1/"></script> -->

                    </p>
                    <p class = "program-box-text">The name United Engineers comes from two sources: the program’s main goal of bringing students together to <b>learn engineering skills and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b>, a focal point of the lessons. We have a fully developed self-made curriculum that works to teach students the Engineering Design Process and guide them through activities based around the UN SDGs. Prior to the COVID-19 Lockdown, we were set to start our workshop series in two New York City schools. We are currently in the middle of planning a virtual Ideathon, set to occur in June.</p>
                    <h3 class = "program-box-subtitle">The Difference</h3>
                    <p class = "program-box-text">Participants gain significant STEM knowledge and apply it to develop a product or idea focused on  sustainability. During the first five weeks of the program, students are taught the Engineering Design Process and other engineering fundamentals like efficiency, mechanical advantage, and making decisions through activity-based lessons. During the last five weeks, students <b>develop solutions to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</b> in groups under mentorship of our team and present them to the community at a Demo Day.</p>
                    <p class = "program-box-text">Students may also choose to enter their projects in a city-wide competition for the chance to win a free trip to the United Nations Headquarters and access to mentors, professionals, and fiscal resources to <b>further develop and realize their sustainable solutions</b>. The program is completely free for schools and youth organizations. United Engineers provides volunteers, curriculum, resources for building and for professional opinion, recognition and incentives, and recruitment materials.</p>

                    <h3 class = "program-box-subtitle">Work With Us</h3>
                    <p class = "program-box-text">We’re here to empower young people and meet a community need. With United Engineers, you’ll be joining a team of students from across the country who are passionate about using <b>STEM for social good</b> and willing to step outside their comfort zones. Our focus on peer-to-peer workshops encourages both our team and the students we hope to impact to better understand how they can use STEM to solve the biggest issues that our world is facing.</p>
                    <p class = "program-box-text">Coordinators and Interns in the United Engineers work to develop unique curriculums, direct students in lessons, and reach out to schools. You will receive training to teach students our lessons. While in-school programs are running, <b>high school & college students</b> can also get involved by applying to volunteer at workshops near them.</p>
                    <p class = "program-box-text">If you are interested in bringing United Engineers to your school, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team at <b>unitedengineers.stemchats@gmail.com</b>. We are a rapidly growing student-run organization that hopes to meet the great demand for desired STEM literacy amongst all young people, and we would be thrilled to hear from you.</p>
