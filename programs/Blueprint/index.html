                    <p class = "box-description">Blueprint is a formal scientific journal, published annually, that focuses on <b>showcasing the highest levels of pre-collegiate research from high school students</b> around the globe. Like its namesake, Blueprint aims to provide a solid foundation for high school students to be introduced to the research publication process. High school finalists selected for publication to the journal are invited to get involved with research opportunities at undergraduate institutions and offered networking opportunities.</p>

                    <p class = "box-description">Despite the increasing number of students pursuing their own scientific research, reputable research journals are often considered “off-limits” to high schoolers. We aim to create a formal scientific journal dedicated exclusively to publishing the work led by these students. Moreover, a <b>double-blind review process ensures that all segments of submissions are equally represented</b>, to help accommodate for the fact that some students may not have access to high-quality labs or other resources to leverage. In the process we hope to empower the next generation of scientific researchers to explore opportunities in STEM industries through the opportunities that we provide.</p>
                    <h3 class = "program-box-subtitle">The Difference</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">Blueprint’s funneling model will connect younger middle school students and high school underclassmen with research mentors, already published in the journal, anchoring them to someone who will encourage their pursuit of scientific research. Moreover, our double-blind review process ensures that all segments of submissions are equally represented, to help accommodate for the fact that some students may not have access to high-quality labs or other resources to leverage. The finalists that are selected for publication to the journal are invited to <b>get involved with apprenticeship, or volunteer opportunities</b> at scientific research institutions or labs in their areas of interest.</p>

                    <h3 class = "program-box-subtitle">Partner with Us</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">We are currently pursuing early-stage partnerships with professors, labs, and institutions offering us advisory in coming months about how best to ensure integrity in our publication process. If you are interested in assisting or sponsoring us, please contact us at <b>blueprint.stemchats@gmail.com</b>. As of now, we are working on refining our publication process and will be opening up submissions for the first edition of the journal in the middle of Summer 2020. Regardless of location, high school students who are interested in publishing with Blueprint should also reach out to our team.</p>
