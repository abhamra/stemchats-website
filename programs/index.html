Selected students will be provided with additional mentorship through STEMchats. This program will target these communities and expose students from underrepresented backgrounds to what the STEM field offers. The program hopes to directly impact students by not only offering lab positions but also the ability for them to prepare for college and beyond by having mentors to offer advice that will prepare them for higher education as well as their careers.</p>
