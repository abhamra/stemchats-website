In Part A, students learn about the fundamental steps in the engineering process. In Part B, students are split up into teams and form engineering projects that address the 17 Sustainable Development Goals from the United Nations. Workshops are taught using a peer-to-peer technique at underserved schools in order to demonstrate the positive and transformative applications of STEM through hands-on activities, engaged discussion, and real time feedback. United Engineers is partnered with Manhattan Youth and has received funding from Roots & Shoots, Griptape, and Karma for Cara for its workshops.

Selected students will be provided with additional mentorship and funding through STEMchats. This program will target these communities and expose students from underrepresented backgrounds to what the STEM field offers. The program hopes to directly impact students by not only offering lab positions but also the ability for them to prepare for college and beyond by having mentors to offer advice that will prepare them for higher education as well as their careers. i-STEM Scholars is partnered and being mentored by Dr. Amanda Stockton, Ph.D. at the Georgia Institute of Technology, providing the opportunity for 10 selected students to participate as volunteer interns in a remote database research project focusing on the chemical analyses of meteorites alongside researchers at Georgia Tech, Kennesaw State, and the University of Central Florida.</p>
