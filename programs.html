A few things that will be in each edition of the newsletter include a "STEM Spotlight" of a teenager making big moves in the STEM field, a short video showing something groundbreaking scientific phenomenons, and at least 3 summaries of STEM breakthroughs. Ultimately, the goal of STEMlights is to provide teens with important STEM information in a creative and interesting way.</p>

A double-blind review process ensures that all segments of submissions are equally represented , to help accommodate for the fact that some students may not have access to high-quality labs or other resources to leverage. Finalists selected for publication to the journal are invited to get involved with internships and volunteer opportunities at scientific research institutions.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">A research program that will connect underprivileged high school students with local professors to perform high-quality, pre-collegiate research. Selected students will be provided with additional mentorship and funding through STEMchats. This program will target these communities and expose students from underrepresented backgrounds to what the STEM field offers. The program hopes to directly impact students by not only offering lab positions but also the ability for them to prepare for college and beyond by having mentors to offer advice that will prepare them for higher education as well as their careers.</p>
